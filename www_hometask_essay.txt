In general, my impressions after text reading: it is awful that corporations collect our confidential info for selling. 
Also it's bad, that we have no anonymity on the internet. I suppose that it'd be better, if all things would be anonymous.
Of course, some bad man can do horror things on the internet but our providers can pass the data of criminal people â€” 
but the website must have no possibility to get income from users' data and to pass on to the NSA, FBI, etc.
